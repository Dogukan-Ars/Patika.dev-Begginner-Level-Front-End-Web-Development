<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>"It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves; immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf Lords; great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine. Nine rings were gifted to the race of Men; who, above all else, desire power.<br>
For within these rings was bound a strength and will to govern each race.<br>
But they were, all of them decieved, for another Ring was made. <br>
In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master ring to control all others.<br>
And into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.<br>
'ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL...'"</p>
